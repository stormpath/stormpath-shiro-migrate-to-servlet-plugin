stormpath-shiro-migrate-to-servlet-plugin
=========================================

An example showing the migration of the basic Stormpath realm for Apache Shiro to using the `stormpath-shiro-servlet-plugin`.

This example starts with the example from the Apache Shiro [step-by-step webapp tutorial](http://shiro.apache.org/webapp-tutorial.html), and 
updates it to use `stormpath-shiro-servlet-plugin`.  The migration steps for any webapp should be similar.
